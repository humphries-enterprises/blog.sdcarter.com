Welcome to (one of) my corners on the internet. This is my personal blog where I might or might not write more than once a month. Below are the various links to other parts of my life if you are interested in knowing more.

[My Personal Landing Page](https://www.sdcarter.com) is where you probably came from. That is where I publish my general working existence including my CV.

[My Brain](https://wiki.sdcarter.com) is my personal wiki hosted on [gitbook](https://gitbook.com) where I mostly keep links that I find, or other prople, might find important.

[My Work](https://wwww.linkedin.com/in/cartersd) is my LinkedIn page which acts as my digital CV and connection point for all things business related.

I post stupid links on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SteveCarter) if you want to follow my every so often RT activites.

Finally, all my work is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/sdcarter) where this and all my own personal sites are statically stored and then delivered via Github Pages.
